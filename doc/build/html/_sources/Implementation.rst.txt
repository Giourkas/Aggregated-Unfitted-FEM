Implementation
==============
The steps for the implementation of the technique follow the below order in general:

1. Build of the mesh using an artificial domain with simple geometry which includes the physical domain.
2. Definition and visualization of cut, inner, outer elements (cells).
3. Clustering of the cut elements with the inner elements of the physical domain.
4. Mapping active degrees of freedom to the aggregation.
5. Assemble to a matrix to solve the weak formulation of the Poisson problem.
6. Strange behaviour remark.
7. Testing.
